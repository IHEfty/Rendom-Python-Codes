`calculator.py` is a more feature-rich calculator application that includes additional functionality such as square, square root, customizable themes, and keyboard shortcuts.

### Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Additional functionality: Square, Square Root
- Clear and Backspace buttons
- Keyboard shortcuts for ease of use
- Customizable themes via a `theme.ini` file

### Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- ConfigParser (for theme management)

### Installation

To run `calculator.py`:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IHEfty/Calculator.py.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Calculator.py
   ```

3. **Install Tkinter (if not already installed):**
   Tkinter is included with most Python installations, but if it's not available, you can install it:

   - **For Ubuntu:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

   - **For Windows:** Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

### Configuration

`calculator.py` supports customizable themes through a `theme.ini` file. You can modify the `theme_name` in the `[default]` section to change the default theme. Additional themes can be added by creating new sections in the file.

### Sample `theme.ini`

```ini
[default]
theme_name = Gray

[Classic]
OFF_WHITE = #F8FAFF
WHITE = #FFFFFF
LIGHT_BLUE = #CCEDFF
LIGHT_GRAY = #F5F5F5
LABEL_COLOR = #25265E
BUTTON_TEXT_COLOR = #25265E
BUTTON_BACKGROUND = #FFFFFF
EQUALS_BACKGROUND = #4A90E2

[Gray]
DARK_GRAY = #1E1E1E
MEDIUM_GRAY = #3C3C3C
LIGHT_GRAY = #E1E1E1
BLUE = #4A90E2
WHITE = #FFFFFF
BUTTON_TEXT_COLOR = #1E1E1E
BUTTON_BACKGROUND = #FFFFFF
EQUALS_BACKGROUND = #1E1E1E
